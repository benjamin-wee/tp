### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `MixedPanel`, `NoteListPanel`, `TodoListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `InternshipApplication` object residing in the `Model`.
* listens on each other in the `Ui` component, as `CommandBox` calls functions in `MainWindow` to `execute()` `Logic`.
* keeps a reference to other `Ui` component, as `MainWindow` keeps references of `NoteListPanel`, `InternshipListPanel` and `NoteListPanel` to implement the switching between each panel.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

### How add feature is implemented

The `add` command allows users to add an internship application to the tracker. The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand` class. It extends `Command`but overrides the `Command#execute` to add an internship application to the tracker.

The sequence diagram below shows how the `AddCommand` object is created:
![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. Parsing

The `AddCommandParser` checks that the user input is in the expected format, if not an exception will be thrown.

Step 2. Execution

The `AddCommand#execute` calls `Model#addApplication`, causing an update to the internship list.

Step 3. Result

The updated model is then saved. A `CommandResult` object with a message containing the execution result of the command is created and returned to `MainWindow#execute`.


### Add contact feature

#### How is the feature implemented

The `add_contact` command allows users to add the contact of a company to an internship application. The implementation of the `add_contact` command is facilitated by the `AddContactCommand` class which is derived from the `Command` superclass, and overrides the `Command#execute` method. 
The parsing process meanwhile involves the `AddressBookParser#parse#` and the `AddContactCommandParser#parse` methods.

The activity diagram below shows the workflow of the `add_contact` command during its execution.

![AddContactActivityDiagram](images/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)

The constructor of the class `AddContactCommand` requires 2 arguments, a valid positive `Integer` index and a `Contact` object, both of which are obtained after the parsing process mentioned above.

The relevant operations from the `Model` interface are `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`, `Model#setApplication` and `Model#updateFilteredInternshipList`.

A sequence diagram is shown here to illustrate the execution process of the `add_contact` command.

![AddContactSequenceDiagram](images/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an explanation on the `add_contact` command's behaviours.

Step 1. Parsing

The `CommandBox#execute` method is invoked when the user's input in `CommandBox` is parsed, which results in the command word being parsed in the method `InternEaseParser#parser`.
The method `AddContactCommandParser#parse` is invoked only if the command word matches `AddContactCommand.COMMAND_WORD`.

Step 2. Execution

The `AddContactCommand#execute` method is invoked and calls are made to the `model` instance. The last shown list of internships are obtained by calling the method `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`.
The internship application where the contact is to be added is then obtained by calling the `UniqueApplicationList#get` method with the specified index. As the InternshipApplication object is
immutable, a new `InternshipApplication` object is created with the contact details. The `Model#setApplication` method is then invoked to update the specified application in the list.

Step 3. Result

The updated model is then saved. A `CommandResult` object with a message containing the execution result of the command is created and returned to `MainWindow#execute`. 
The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the returned message for 2.5 seconds. 

>**NOTE:**
> Error handling: Any error message returned in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and the current command executed terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `AddContactCommand` provides enhancement to the existing `AddCommand` by separating the process of adding contact details of the company from the initial process of
adding a new internship application. This prevents the `AddCommand` from getting cluttered with large amount of arguments that may become difficult for the user to remember. 

**Aspect: Where to save the contact details:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separating it into a separate `Contact` class.
    * Pros: Flexibility to add more details to the contact if needed in the future.
    * Cons: More time required to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Adding contact details as attributes in the `InternshipApplication` class.
    * Pros: Easier than implement.
    * Cons: More conflicts will occur if someone else is working on the `InternshipApplication` class at the same time.


### Find feature

The `find` command allows user to find all `InternshipApplication` whose 
1. `CompanyName` and `JobTitle` contain the specified keyword, or
2. `Internship status` contain the specified status, or
3. `InterviewDate` is before, after, or between specified date(s).

>**NOTE:**
> The matching of keyword in `CompanyName` and `JobTitle` is case-insensitive. As long as one word within CompanyName` 
> and `JobTitle` matches any of the KEYWORDS, it will be shown in result.

#### How is the feature implemented

The sequence diagram below describes the interaction between classes when find command entered.
![FindSequenceDiagram](./images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. Parsing

If the command word matches the word "find", `FindCommandParser#parse()` will be called to parse 
the argument of find. The parsing logic is further divided into three cases below:
- Case 1: If the prefix `s/` is specified, the argument that follows the prefix immediately is 
deemed as `InternshipStatus`. A `FindStatusCommand` with `StatusPredicate` is created to be executed. 
- Case 2: If one of the following prefixes `before/`, `after/`, OR `from/` and `to/` is specified, the argument
that follows immediately is deemed as `InterviewDate`. A `FindDateCommand` with appropriate subclasses of
`DatePredicate` is created to be executed. 
- Case 3: If none of the prefix among `s/`, `before/`, `after/`, `from/`, `to/` is specified 
in the argument. `FindCommandParser` constructs a `FindCommand` object and treat all arguments that follow as `KEYWORD`

Step 2. Execution

The corresponding command is then invoked. Within each command's `execute` method, 
`Model#updateFilteredInternshipList()` is invoked by passing in the predicate. For Cases 1 and 2, 
only those `InternshipApplication`'s with matching `ApplicationStatus` or `InterviewDate` are added to the Model's
`filteredInternships` whereas for Case 3, if any word within the `CompanyName` or `JobTitle` matches one of the 
`KEYWORD`(s), then that application is added to the Model's `filteredInternships`.

Step 3. Result

The updated model is then saved. A `CommandResult` object with a message containing the execution result of the command 
is created and returned to `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` 
displaying the returned message for 2.5 seconds.


#### Why is it implemented this way

The class diagram below shows current structure of classes related to `find` command.
![FindFeatureClassDiagram](./images/FindFeatureClassDiagram.png)

It is designed and implemented in this way to make the find command more extensible to further enhancement to be made.
For example, developer may want to enable more prefixes that be searched using the search command. By the 
use of inheritance, one can easily modify the behaviour of `find` command through overrding of the `execute` command
and rely on polymorphism.

#### Alternatives considered

**Syntax of `find` command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Now to find attribute in `InternshipApplication`, the command syntax used is
by using its prefix, i.e. in this form `find s/PENDING`. 
  * Pros: shorter command
  * Cons: Parser logic is harder to maintain as compared to Alternative 2

* **Alternative 2:** We can also make it in such format find_<Attribute>, e.g. find_status. 
  * Pros: Easy parser to implement
  * Cons: Longer command which takes longer time to type


### Clear feature
This section elaborated the `clear` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `ClearCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How CLEAR Feature is implemented

The `clear` feature enables user to clear all internship applications in the current internship application list.

The execution process of `clear` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `clear` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `clear`.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
`ClearCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `Internship Applications` by `Model#getSortedFilteredInternshipList`.
If the application list is currently not empty, `Model#setInternEase` empties the application list by replacing it with a new InternEase instance while `Model#addAllInternshipToCache` adds the entire list into the cacheList.

Step 3. Result <br/>
The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `ClearFeature` is an enhanced extension for the `DeleteFeature`. It provides an execution for a series operations of the `DeleteCommands` at once.


### Clear By feature
This section elaborated the `clear_by` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `ClearByCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How CLEAR_BY Feature is implemented

The `clear_by` feature enables user to clear the internship applications in batch with the specific attribute and the specific keyword. There are 3 cases (attributes) available in this feature.
In `Logic` interface, `ClearByCommand` extends `Command` with a `ClearByCommand#execute` functionality. The parsing process is facilitated by both the `InternEaseParser#parse` and `ClearByCommandParser#parse`.

The workflow of a `clear_by` command during its execution is shown by the activity diagram below:
![ClearByActivityDiagram](images/ClearByActivityDiagram.png) <br/>
Group - Company Name <br/>
![GroupCompanyName](images/GroupCompanyName.png) <br/>
Group - Job Title <br/>
![GroupJobTitle](images/GroupJobTitle.png) <br/>
Group - Status <br/>
![GroupStatus](images/GroupStatus.png) <br/>

There are 3 constructors `ClearByCommand::new` provided for 3 different cases stated below : 

* Case 1 : clear_by `COMPANY_NAME`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `n`
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=COMPANYNAME` fully match with the provided keyword.
  
* Case 2 : clear_by `JOB_TITLE`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `j`
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=JOBTITLE` fully match with the provided keyword.
  
* Case 3 : clear_by `STATUS`
  * `PREFIX` should be set to `s`, the keywords accepted include `ACCEPTED, PENDING, RECEIVED, REJECTED, DECLINED`.
  * Allows user to remove all internship applications with `ParamType=STATUS` fully match with the correct provided keyword.

>**Note:** 
> The assignation of cases will be done by `ClearByCommandParser#parse`, each unavailable fields will be set to null.

These operations are involved in the `Model` interface as `Model#getSortedFilteredInternshipList`, `Model#addInternshipToCache` and `Model#deleteInternship`

The execution process of `Clear_by` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
![ClearBySequenceDiagram](images/ClearBySequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `clear_by` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
    The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `clear_by`, it will then be passed to `ClearByCommandParser#parse`.
    The `PREFIX` in the argument will then be investigated. Different constructor of `ClearByCommand` object will be using based on the `PREFIX`.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
    `ClearByCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `Internship Applications` by `Model#getSortedFilteredInternshipList`. Then, the list is filtered by `ClearByCommand#getFilteredList` to filter out the applications to be cleared.
    The size of the list-to-clear is checked before an iteration to `Model#deleteInternship` and `Model#addInternshipToCache`. The cleared items are stored in the cacheList to support `RevertCommand` in current InternEase session.
    
Step 3. Result <br/>
    The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `ClearByCommand` is an enhanced feature for both `DeleteCommand` and `ClearCommand`. It resolves user's request to perform customized batch deletion of internship applications.
Based on utility, the 3 fixed fields in an internship application are taken as the key attributes for this `clear_by` feature. The `PREFIX` for specifying the `clear_by` attribute is also the same as InternEase convention.
For the ease of implementation and avoid ambiguity, constructor `ClearByCommand::new` is overloaded, taking different fields. The usage of enum `ParamType` to specify the operating attribute type generalized the `ClearByCommand#execute`.
The other implementation aspects of `clear_by` feature follow the convention of `InternEase`.


### Delete feature
This section elaborated the `delete` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `DeleteCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How DELETE Feature is implemented

The `delete` feature enables user to delete an internship applications with the specified index. 
In `Logic` interface, `DeleteCommand` extends `Command` with a `DeleteCommand#execute` functionality. The parsing process is facilitated by both the `InternEaseParser#parse` and `DeleteCommandParser#parse`.

All the delete operations should only have INDEX within the displayed Internship Application List.
The deleted application(s) in current session (after InternEase initialization, before exit) will be cached in a cacheList to enable the `revert` and `revert_all` features.

These operations are involved in the `Model` interface as `Model#getSortedFilteredInternshipList`, `Model#addInternshipToCache` and `Model#deleteInternship`

The execution process of `delete` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `delete` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `delete`, it will then be passed to `DeleteCommandParser#parse`.
The `INDEX` in the argument will then be investigated.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
`DeleteCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `Internship Applications` by `Model#getSortedFilteredInternshipList`. The `INDEX` is checked against the size of the current Internship Application to ensure that it is within the desired range.
The `internshipToDelete` is retrieved from the filteredList and deleted from the model by `Model#deleteInternship`. The deleted item is stored in the cacheList to support `RevertCommand` and `RevertAllCommand` in the current InternEase session.

Step 3. Result <br/>
The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `DeleteCommand` is a common, must-have feature which helps to clean-up unwanted internship applications to enhance user experience. The cacheList provides an extra protection to the data to buffer the effect of this destructive operation.


### Revert feature
This section elaborated the `revert` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `RevertCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How REVERT Feature is implemented

The `revert` feature enables user to revert the most recent deleted internship applications.
In `Logic` interface, `RevertCommand` extends `Command` with a `RevertCommand#execute` functionality. The parsing process is facilitated by the `InternEaseParser#parse`.

All the revert operations can be operated when the cacheList for the current session is not empty.
The reverted application(s) in current session (after InternEase initialization, before exit) will be removed from the cacheList and be added to the end of the current internship application list.

These operations are involved in the `Model` interface as `Model#getCachedInternshipList`, `Model#getAndRemoveCachedApplication` and `Model#addApplication`.

The execution process of `revert` is demonstrated by the activity diagram below.
![RevertActivityDiagram](images/RevertActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `revert` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `revert`.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
`RevertCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `cached Internship Applications` by `Model#getCachedInternshipList`. 
The `most recent cached Internship Application` is retrieved from the cacheList and deleted from it by `Model#getAndRemoveCachedApplication`. The retrieved item is added back to the end of the internship application list by `Model#addApplication`.

Step 3. Result <br/>
The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `RevertFeature` adds an extra cacheList provides an extra protection to the data to counter the destructive effect of the `ClearFeatures` and the `DeleteFeature`. The cacheList does not write in the memory space to provide
a temporary data-storing data structure that acts as a buffer for the current session's operations.

#### Alternatives considered

**Functionality of `revert` command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Currently, only the revert of a single deleted / cleared internship application is available. 
    * Pros: Shorter command, easy to implement.
    * Cons: Less efficient as compared to Alternative 2.

* **Alternative 2:** We can also make it in such format revert <INDEX>, e.g. revert 3, reverts 3 most recent deleted internship applications.
    * Pros: More powerful feature.
    * Cons: More complicate to implement.
  

### Revert All feature
This section elaborated the `revert_all` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `RevertAllCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How REVERT_ALL Feature is implemented

The `revert_all` feature enables user to revert all deleted and cleared internship applications in the current session (after InternEase initialization, before exit).

The execution process of `revert_all` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
![RevertAllSequenceDiagram](images/RevertAllSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `revert_all` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `revert_all`.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
`RevertAllCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It attempts to get full list of `cached Internship Applications` by `Model#getCachedInternshipList`.
If the cacheList is currently not empty, `Model#setEmptyInternshipCacheList` empties the cacheList while `Model#addApplications` adds the entire list to the end of the current internship application list.

Step 3. Result <br/>
The result model is saved. A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the execution message for 5 seconds.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `RevertAllFeature` is an enhanced extension for the `RevertFeature`. It provides an execution for the series operations of the `RevertFeatures` at once.


### Exit feature
This section elaborated the `exit` feature by its functionality and the path of execution together with the `ExitCommand` implementation. Uml diagrams are used to aid this description.

#### How Exit Feature is implemented

The `exit` feature enables user to close InternEase using CLI command.

The execution process of `exit` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.
![ExitSequenceDiagram](images/ExitSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is a step-wise explanation on `exit` mechanism's behaviour.

Step 1. Parsing <br/>
The user input in the `CommandBox` will trigger `CommandBox#execute`, will result in the command word processing in `InternEaseParser#parse`. If the `COMMAND.WORD` matches `exit`.

Step 2. Execution <br/>
`ExitCommand#execute` is called with `model` instance. It directly returns a command result with `exit` parameter being set to `True`. 

Step 3. Result <br/>
A `CommandResult` with execution result message is returned until the `MainWindow#execute`. The `ResultDialog` displays the execution message for 5 seconds.
`MainWindow#handleExit` handle the exit operation by recording current gui settings and hiding all the opened windows. The InternEase software shuts down eventually.

>**NOTE:** <br/>
> Error handling: Any error message resulted in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and current execution terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `ExitFeature` is a general, must-have feature. All the windows are cleaned-up upon exit to prevent illegal running of InternEase processes and the trigger of null-pointer exceptions.
The `ExitFeature` also acts as the termination point for cacheList usage in the current session.


### Add Interview Date feature 

#### How is the feature implemented

The `add_date` command allows users to add an interview date to an internship application. The implementation of the `add_date` command is facilitated by the `AddInterviewDateCommand` class which is derived from the `Command` superclass, and overrides the `Command#execute` method.
The parsing process meanwhile involves the `AddressBookParser#parse#` and the `AddInterviewDateCommandParser#parse` methods.

The constructor of the class `AddInterviewDateCommand` requires 2 arguments, a valid positive `Integer` index and a `InterviewDate` object, both of which are obtained after the parsing process mentioned above.

The relevant operations from the `Model` interface are `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`, `Model#setApplication` and `Model#updateFilteredInternshipList`.

Given below is an explanation on the `add_contact` command's behaviours.

Step 1. Parsing

The `CommandBox#execute` method is invoked when the user's input in `CommandBox` is parsed, which results in the command word being parsed in the method `InternEaseParser#parser`.
The method `AddInterviewDateCommandParser#parse` is invoked only if the command word matches `AddInterviewDateCommand.COMMAND_WORD`.

Step 2. Execution

The `AddInterviewDateCommand#execute` method is invoked and calls are made to the `model` instance. The last shown list of internships are obtained by calling the method `Model#getFilteredInternshipList`.
The internship application where the interview date is to be added is then obtained by calling the `UniqueApplicationList#get` method with the specified index. As the InternshipApplication object is
immutable, a new `InternshipApplication` object is created with the interview date. The `Model#setApplication` method is then invoked to update the specified application in the list.

Step 3. Result

The updated model is then saved. A `CommandResult` object with a message containing the execution result of the command is created and returned to `MainWindow#execute`.
The `InternshipListPanel` is refreshed with a `ResultDialog` displaying the returned message for 2.5 seconds.

>**NOTE:**
> Error handling: Any error message returned in the midst of execution will be displayed as a `ResultDialog` and the current command executed terminates immediately.

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `AddInterviewDateCommand` provides enhancement to the existing `AddCommand` by separating the process of adding the interview date for an application from the initial process of
adding a new internship application. This prevents the `AddCommand` from getting cluttered with large amount of arguments that may become difficult for the user to remember.

**Aspect: Where to save the contact details:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separating it into a separate `InterviewDate` class.
    * Pros: Flexibility to add more details to the contact if needed in the future.
    * Cons: More time required to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Adding interview date as an attribute in the `InternshipApplication` class.
    * Pros: Easier than implement.
    * Cons: More conflicts will occur if someone else is working on the `InternshipApplication` class at the same time.

### Side Features
**All the side features share similar execution paths as their respective main features execution logic, only minor changes are applied.**

For example, the main differences in these features are on the specific functions used to carry out the execution and the specific lists used to store the relevant items. <br/>
  - `Task` is a combination of `Todo` and `Note`.<br/>
  - `TodoList` or `NoteList` are used instead of `InternshipApplicationList`, and other relevant data structure.<br/>
  - Methods with `Todo` or `Note` are used instead of `Application` or `Internship` (e.g., updateFiltered`Todo`List and updateFiltered`Note`List are used instead of updateFiltered`Internship`List).<br/>
  - CacheList is not applicable.<br/>
  - All the commands (include main features) can be executed in any of the panels. It will automatically switch to the related panel and display the results after every execution.<br/>
  - All commands need to go through the `TaskParser` after being processed in the `InternEaseParser`.<br/>
  - For GUI settings, `Todo` uses `TodoListPanel`, `Note` uses `NoteListPanel`, while `Task` uses `MixedPanel`.<br/>


  
### Task related features

### Find Task feature
#### How is the feature implemented

The `FindTaskFeature` provides searching function on `Todo` and `Note` with keywords.
The execution of `FindTaskCommand` is similar to `FindCommand` except it takes no prefix(purely keywords) and it searches on `InternshipTodo` company name and `Note` content.

The execution process of `find_task` is demonstrated by the sequence diagram below.<br/>
![FindTaskSequenceDiagram](images/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Why is it implemented this way

The `FindFeature` on `InternshipTodo` and `Note` are put together as `FindTaskFeature` because they have the same characteristic as a `Task`. It will enable the planning of internship
application to be more effective.


### List Task feature
#### How is the feature implemented
